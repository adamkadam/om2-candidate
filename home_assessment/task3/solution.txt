The solution I offer:
1. Store the list of features to be installed and users to be created in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store (which can also handle secrets).
2. For dedicated secret management, user credentials can be managed via AWS Secrets Manager.
3. Use a PowerShell script to fetch and apply the desired configurations for convenience and automation.
